All the theme files for this theme are based on existing ones, but have been heavily modified. Credit will still be given to the original themes.

I think everything needed should be in there, let me know if there are missing elements.

Please also note that the configuration seen in the screenshots has been perfectly adapted to my screen resolution and DPI (1920 x 1080 at 100% scale), so you might need to modify the size and placement of widgets and panels, as well as some wallpaper elements and the window snapping script. For that, I included the .xcf file.

Here is how to setup everything

System Settings (apply the same in QT5 settings):

- Global theme: Daemon

and/or:

- Application style: Kvantum-dark

- Plasma style: Daemon (modified from Nova Color)

- Colors: Daemon

- Window decorations: Daemon (modified from Fireflies Dark Round)

- Font: Prototype

- Icons: Daemon (modified from Simply Cyan Circles)

- Cursor: Bibata-Original-Classic

- Kwin scripts: Flex grid (I provided a version with modified settings to accomodate my setup)

- Desktop effects/Window open/close animation: TV Effect [Burn-My-Windows]


Kvantum Settings:

- Kvantum theme: Daemon (modified from KvCurves)

Others:

- Discord theme


Additional Notes:

I left batch color changing scripts in the Daemon icon theme, so you can easily change the colors to your liking in case you want a completely different color scheme.

This theme has been heavily inspired by the CyberRe GRUB theme : https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1420727
